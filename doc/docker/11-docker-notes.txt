We are now logged into a new container, with the catchy ID of f7cbdac22a02 , as
the root user. This is a fully fledged Ubuntu host, and we can do anything we
like in it. Let’s explore it a bit, starting with asking for its hostname. 

Docker then used this image to create a new container inside a filesystem. The
container has a network, IP address, and a bridge interface to talk to the local
host.

The Ubuntu image is actually a series of images collected under a single
repository. We call it the Ubuntu operating system, but really it is not the
full operating system. It’s a cut-down version with the bare runtime required to
run the distribution.
