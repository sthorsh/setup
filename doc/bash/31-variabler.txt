VARIABLER

Tilordning
  En tilordningssetning er en form for enkeltkommando

  > Shell variable assignments (i.e., words of the form var=value) are a kind of simple command themselves.
  > Assignment statements can either stand alone on a command line or precede a command name.
  > If they're not followed by a command name, the assignment statements modify the shell's state.
  > If they precede a command, the variables are passed to the executed command in its environment
  >   • if they precede a shell function they persist, with a few exceptions, only as long as the function executes
  >   • if they precede a built-in command they persist, with a few exceptions, only as long as the builtin executes
