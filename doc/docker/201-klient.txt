Client container mgmt without ssh
  We need to sign into a container: $ docker exec ... (cf ssh)
  We need to send a signal to a container: $ docker kill ...
  Service is managed via a network if: expose that (networking)
  Service is managed through a Unix socket: expose it with a volume (volumes)
