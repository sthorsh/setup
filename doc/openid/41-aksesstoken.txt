Husk
  Access tokens do not represent an authenticated user (oauth != authentication)
  An access tokens intended audience is the protected resource
  The client app should have no need to look inside the token
  The client app should have no need to try and validate the access token
  The client app should just request the token and pass it on to the protected resource
  There is no way for the client to reliably verify the access token
  The authz server has no obligation to its clients regarding access token format or scheme
