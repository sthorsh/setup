Input
   <word      (for cmd) open file word for reading on stdin
  N<word      (for cmd) open file word for reading on file descriptor 3..9

 --------------------------------------------------

Redirection
  • allows commands’ file handles to be opened, closed, duplicated, made to refer to different files
  • can change the files the command reads from and writes to
  • may also be used to modify file handles in the current shell execution environment

Redirection operators
  • may precede a simple command
  • may appear anywhere within a simple command
  • may follow a simple command

Redirections
  • the rhs i.e <word> undergo expansions and quote removal
  • are processed in the order they appear, from left to right
  • the order of redirections is significant e.g > 2>&1 not 2>&1 >

Command/process I/O
  • Input: stdin kbd, ...
  • Output: stdout screen, ...
  • Error: stderr screen, ...

Filer
  • /dev/fd/N 
  • /dev/null
  • /dev/stdin
  • /dev/stdout
  • /dev/stderr
  • Redirections using file descriptors greater than 9 should be used with care, as they may
conflict with file descriptors the shell uses internally.
