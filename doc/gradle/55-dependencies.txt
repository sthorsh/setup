Dependency declaration
  Form 1 
  Form 2

Declaring a dependency on a component is usually done by providing a set of coordinates (group,
artifact, version also known as GAV coordinates). This allows the engine to determine the
component we’re looking for, but such a component may provide different variants. A variant is
typically chosen based on the usage. For example, we might choose a different variant for
compiling against a component (in which case we need the API of the component) or when
executing code (in which case we need the runtime of the component). All variants of a component
provide a number of capabilities, which are denoted similarly using GAV coordinates.

A capability is denoted by GAV coordinates, but you must think of it as feature description:
  • "I provide an SLF4J binding"
  • "I provide runtime support for MySQL"
  • "I provide a Groovy runtime"
And in general, having two components that provide the same thing in the graph is a problem 
(they conflict).

Dependency constraints
  Allows you to define a version or a version range  
  Applies to both direct and transitive dependencies
  Use case 1: enforce a version of a transitive dependency
  Use case 2: exclude a transitive dependency from the graph
