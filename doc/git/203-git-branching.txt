GIT BRANCHING

3.1 Git branching - branches in a nutshell

  Some people refer to Git’s branching model as its killer feature.
  
  The way Git branches is incredibly lightweight, making branching operations nearly instantaneous.
  
  Git encourages workflows that branch and merge often, even multiple times in a day. 
  
  Mastering this feature can entirely change the way that you develop.
  
  When you make a commit, Git stores a commit object that contains a pointer to the snapshot of the content you staged.
  
  A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to a commit.
  
  A branch in Git is actually a simple file that contains the 40 character SHA-1 checksum of the commit it points to.

3.2 Git branching - basic branching and merging
  
  This is an important point to remember: when you switch branches, Git resets your working directory to look like it
  did the last time you committed on that branch. It adds, removes, and modifies files automatically to make sure your
  working copy is what the branch looked like on your last commit to it.

  Git does a simple three-way merge, using the two snapshots pointed to by the branch tips and the common ancestor of
  the two. Instead of just moving the branch pointer forward, Git creates a new snapshot that results from this three-way
  merge and automatically creates a new commit that points to it. This is referred to as a merge commit, and is special in
  that it has more than one parent.

  Now that your work is merged in, you have no further need for the iss53 branch. You can close the issue in your
  issue-tracking system, and delete the branch
