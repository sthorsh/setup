PROSJEKT

Project
  A project does not necessarily represent a thing to be built.
  A project might represent a web application or a library JAR. 
  A project might represent a thing to be done, such as deploying.

Task
  A task represents some atomic piece of work which a build performs.
  Each task is available as a build script property: clean.doFirst {...}
  You may define default tasks that are executed if no tasks are specified.
