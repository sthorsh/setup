GRADLE DSL

Basics
  Gradle scripts are _configuration_ scripts
  Gradle scripts implement the Script interface

Scripts → delegate object
  Init script init.gradle → Gradle
  Settings script settings.gradle → Settings
  Build script build.gradle → Project

Build script
  Looks mostly like configuration.
  The configuration is based on Groovy constructs.
  The constructs relate to Gradle’s API documentation.
  Every build script is backed by an instance of Project.

Build script
  Statements
  Script blocks
  Elements allowed in a Groovy script: class|method defs

Statement
  Method calls
  Property assignments
  Local variable definitions

Script block
  A method call which takes a closure as a parameter.
  The closure configures some delegate object as it executes.

Top level script blocks
  allprojects{}
  dependencies{}
  repositories{}
  ...
