Build Script Basics

  The block passed to the buildscript() method configures a ScriptHandler instance. You declare the build script classpath
  by adding dependencies to the classpath configuration. This is the same way you declare, for example, the Java
  compilation classpath. You can use any of the dependency types except project dependencies.
  
  For multi-project builds, the dependencies declared with a projectâ€™s buildscript() method are available to the build
  scripts of all its sub-projects.
  
  Build script dependencies may be Gradle plugins. Please consult Using Gradle Plugins for more information on Gradle
  plugins.
  
! Every project automatically has a buildEnvironment task of type BuildEnvironmentReportTask that can be invoked to report
  on the resolution of the build script dependencies.
